compareTo(Word o) //in word class
I compare the text field of both Word objects in order to determine if the word is in the 
binary search tree when contains is called.

Printing fileLists
I could not figure out a good way to print using the binary search tree, so I added each 
Word object to an ArrayList in addition to the Binary search tree in order to make printing
their fileLists simpler. As a result, my words and their filelists will print in an odd
order when the a command is called.
