FileSearcher
Essentially the main of this respository. This project creates a binary
search tree in which the words in all of the files, along with the files
in which they are located are stored. This file, when ran, gives the user
a choice of seeing all of the words, where a specific word they are looking
for is located, and to quit from the search. For this to work, you would
need to load the path of the directory from command line or an environment
that allows for a command line input.
